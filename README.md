# CIS-194

Me going through the Haskell course CIS-194 from University of Pennsylvania. Descriptions of programs are as follows:

creditCard.hs : Implements a credit card validation algorithm.

mastermind.hs : Implements a solver for the game Mastermind. 
Here is a wikipedia link. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)

polynomial.hs : Implements a typeclass for polynomials to be represented as lists. 
Operations include addition, multiplication, negating the polynomial, creating a
polynomial type from an integer, evaluating a polynomial at a given number, and
taking derivatives.
